API---Application Programming Interface

API full form is an Application Programming Interface that is a collection of communication protocols and subroutines used by various programs to communicate between them.

1. Open APIs
It is also called public APIs which are available to any other users. Open APIs help external users to access data and services. It is an open-source application programming interface that we access with HTTP protocols. 

2.  Internal APIs
It is also known as private API, only an internal system exposes this type of API. These are designed for the internal use of the company rather than the external users.

3. Composite APIs
It is a type of API that combines different data and services. The main reason to use Composites APIs is to improve the performance and speed up the execution process and improve the performance of the listeners in the web interfaces.

SCM 

Source Code Management tools are essential for version control, collaboration, and efficient software development. 
They allow teams to track changes, maintain code versions, and coordinate among developers.


Key Features of SCM Tools:
1. Version Control: Track changes to source code over time and revert to previous versions if needed.

2. Branching and Merging: Enable multiple developers to work on different features or fixes simultaneously and merge their changes.

3. Collaboration: Facilitate team collaboration by allowing simultaneous work on shared codebases.syncronized way .

4. Conflict Resolution: Provide mechanisms to identify and resolve conflicts when merging changes.

5. History Tracking: Keep a detailed log of who made changes, when, and why.

tools:-

GIT,GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket.

------------------
Benefits of SCM Tools:

 1 .Enhances collaboration and productivity.
 2. Ensures code quality and reduces errors.
 3. Facilitates continuous integration and deployment.
 4. Provides a secure way to store and manage code.
